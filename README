Train2ME training specification syntax
--------------------------------------

Training specification files for Train2ME have the '.training' extension
and must follow a strict syntax. The file is made up of lines of
tab-separated fields.

The first field of the first line dictates the number of information
regions used by the training. Information regions should be thought of
as textboxes on the screen of the device. We will use NUM to indicate
this number in this document.

The next NUM lines specify the layout of the information regions. Each
line must consist of the following 4 fields in the given order:
 1. The horizontal (x) coordinate of the region's anchor point
 2. The vertical (y) coordinate of the region's anchor point
 3. The height of the region
 4. The position of the anchor point relative to the region.
    Possible values are:
     -  LEFT (the region is to the right of its anchor point)
     -  CENTER (the region is horizontally centered around its anchor
        point)
     -  RIGHT (the region is to the left of its anchor point)
The contents of a region are scaled to match the region's height and
extend above the vertical coordinate of its anchor point. Coordinates
and height are measured in pixels. The top left corner of the screen
has coordinate pair (0, 0) and all visible points have positive
coordinates.

After these lines the contents of the regions are specified. A training
is divided into consecutive epochs. Each epoch is represented by NUM
lines in the specification. The nth line of the NUM lines specifies the
contents of the nth region during the specified epoch. Empty lines are
ignored, as are lines starting with '//'.

The first field of every line of content specification contains the name
of a content provider. The remaining fields are parameters of the
content provider. Currently supported providers and there arguments
are:
 -  Distance [.][m* | km | NM] [<distance>]
    A '.' in front of the unit prevents the unit from being shown.
    If <distance> is left unspecified, the total distance is shown. If
    <distance> is 0, the total distance is reset. For any other value of
    <distance>, the distance is shown decreasing from the provided
    value. Once the distance reaches zero, the training moves to the
    next epoch.
 -  Metronome [<bpm>]
 -  Speed [.][m/s* | km/h | kt | min/km] [<minimum>] [<maximum>]
    A '.' in front of the unit prevents the unit from being shown.
 -  Text [<text>]
    When no text is provided, the contents of the region from the
    previous epoch will be retained.
 -  Time
 -  Timer [.][s* | min | h] [<time>]
    Similar to Distance.
 -  Wait [<text>]
    Similar to Text, but a Continue button is added to the interface,
    which triggers the start of the next epoch.
Default parameter values are marked with a *.
